# Training a network for photon identification in CMS 

Step 1 : Make sure, all the necessary packages are installed.

Step 2 : check the absolute path of the root file .

Step 3 : check "utils.py" is important for reading the root file and making numpy arrays of data for further processing.

Step 4 : TMVA-BDTG, XGBoost and SKLearn uses gradient boosting decision tree algorithm for classification of signal and background events.

Step 5 : A Tensorflow-Keras based DNN network has also been developed for the study to compare the performances.
